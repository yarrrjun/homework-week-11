# Week 11 Note Taker
## Description
Sometimes, we just need to take notes to reference later. Note Taker is an application that can be used to write, save, and delete notes. The app saves user input into a JSON object list that is appended to the left panel. Notes can be deleted by clicking the trash icon, and saved by clicking the floppy disk icon.
